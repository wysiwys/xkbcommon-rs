# Changelog

# 0.1.1

Minor version update corresponding to libxkbcommon 1.7.0.

## Fixes
- Track `Cargo.lock` for dependency version consistency.
- A version update for `unicase` changed the hash function, causing the keysym tables generated by `phf` to break. This was fixed in #4 by upgrading the versions of affected libraries (contributed by @Super-Pizza).
- Pin exact versions of `unicase` and `phf` dependencies to avoid similar issues in the future.
